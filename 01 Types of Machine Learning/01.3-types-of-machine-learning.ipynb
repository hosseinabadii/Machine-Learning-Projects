    "Self-supervised learning refers to an unsupervised learning problem that is framed as a supervised learning problem in order to apply supervised learning algorithms to solve it. Supervised learning algorithms are used to solve an alternate or pretext task, the result of which is a model or representation that can be used in the solution of the original (actual) modeling problem.\n",

    "Multi-instance learning is a supervised learning problem where individual examples are unlabeled; instead, bags or groups of samples are labeled. Instances are in “bags” rather than sets because a given instance may be present one or more times, e.g. duplicates.  \n",
    "Modeling involves using knowledge that one or some of the instances in a bag are associated with a target label, and to predict the label for new bags in the future given their composition of multiple unlabeled examples.\n"
