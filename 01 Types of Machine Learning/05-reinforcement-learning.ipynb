    "Reinforcement learning works on a feedback-based process, in which an AI agent (A software component) automatically explore its surrounding by hitting & trail, taking action, learning from experiences, and improving its performance. Agent gets rewarded for each good action and get punished for each bad action; hence the goal of reinforcement learning agent is to maximize the rewards.\n",

    "A reinforcement learning problem can be formalized using Markov Decision Process(MDP). In MDP, the agent constantly interacts with the environment and performs actions; at each action, the environment responds and generates a new state."
