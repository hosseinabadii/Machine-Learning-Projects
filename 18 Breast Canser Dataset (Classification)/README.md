# Breast Cancer Prediction

Features in this dataset are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle
aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.  They describe
characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

The subject of this project is to use this dataset for predictiong the Breast Canser.

## Data Set Characteristics

Number of Instances: 569

Number of Attributes: 30 numeric, predictive attributes and the class

## Attribute Information

1. radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
2. texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
3. perimeter
4. area
5. smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
6. compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
7. concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
8. concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
9. symmetry
10. fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

## Class Information

- Malignant Breast Cancer (1)
- Benign Breast Cancer (0)

## Extra Information

The mean, standard error, and "worst" or largest (mean of the three
worst/largest values) of these features were computed for each image,
resulting in 30 features.  For instance, field 0 is Mean Radius, field
10 is Radius SE, field 20 is Worst Radius.
