# Machine Learning Projects
Welcome to the Machine Learning Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects categorized into four groups: classification, regression, clustering, and association rules. Each category explores different algorithms and techniques to solve various types of problems.

## Introduction

Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms and models that can learn from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. This repository showcases a range of machine learning projects that demonstrate the application of different algorithms and methodologies.

## Categories

### 1. Classification

Classification is a supervised learning task where the goal is to predict the class or category of a given input. The following classification algorithms are included in this repository:

- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest

### 2. Regression

Regression is a supervised learning task that aims to predict a continuous numerical value based on input variables. The following regression algorithms are included in this repository:

- Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest Regression

### 3. Clustering

Clustering is an unsupervised learning task where the goal is to group similar data points together. The following clustering algorithms are included in this repository:

- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering

### 4. Association Rules

Association rules mining is a technique used to discover relationships or patterns in transactional data. The following association rule algorithms are included in this repository:

- Apriori Algorithm
- FP-Growth Algorithm
- Eclat Algorithm
